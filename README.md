Sorting Visualizer using HTML CSS and Javascript. In this project, the user can visualize the step-by-step implementation of various sorting algorithms, including selection, bubble, insertion, merge, quick, and heap sorts. along with this, there is the speed feature which allows the user to control the speed of the visualization screen and also user can control the size of the array. there are 5 different levels of speed as well as the size of the array which can be changed by the user. and if the user selects any algorithm that times the size and speed button will be blocked. once that operation will get finished then only those buttons will be functional. For the front-end, part I used HTML and CSS, and for the backend I used Javascript.
